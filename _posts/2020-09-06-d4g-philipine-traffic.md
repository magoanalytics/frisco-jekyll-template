## Road accidents kill thousands of Filipinos every year.

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 1.1</b> Road Traffic Deaths in SEA, 1990 - 2017</i></figcaption>
Based from a dataset from a [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/inaugural-who-partners-forum/who-interim-recommendation-on-obligatory-hand-hygiene-against-transmission-of-covid-19.pdf){:target="_blank_"}, the Philippines is among the top 5 countries with highest mortality rates with relation to road traffic accidents, with roughly 10 thousand deaths recorded in the year 2017.

Looking at red trend line that represents the Philippines in <b>Figure 1.1</b>, we can see that the mortality rate for road traffic accidents almost increases every year for the Philippines. Other countries like Indonesia, Thailand, and Myanmar, despite having high mortality rates, have their trendlines going down for each year, which is what we also want for the Philippines.

## How much has each country invested?

To give more context on what's happening, data from the [Private Participation in Infrastructure Database](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IE.PPI.TRAN.CD){:target="_blank_"} shows the total amount each country in SEA has invested in improving their respective transport infrastructure.

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 2.1</b> Latest investment for public transport (per capita) in SEA</i></figcaption>

Among the countries with available data in SEA on <b>Figure 2.1</b>, we can see that the Philippines is in 5th place with around $16,000 per capita invested.

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 2.2</b> Road Traffic Deaths in SEA, 2017 (Sorted by Investment Rank)</i></figcaption>

If we actually retain the order of countries in <b>Figure 2.1</b> and replace the values with the total amount of road traffic deaths, we can see in <b>Figure 2.2</b> that the countries that have invested the most in their transport infrastructure have the least amount of deaths in this list. The Philippines could actually do better by investing more money in transport, and even if we don't, we have countries like Myanmar that have invested far less than us but roughly has the same amount of casualties than us in 2017, so its just the matter of knowing where to focus our efforts.

This is something that's relevant to discuss, especially because the [Philippine government promises to halve road crash fatalities by 2030](https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/2/24/Halve-road-crash-fatalities-Philippines-.html){:target="_blank_"}. In order to make sure that the additional investments allotted for road transport to be successful, lets dig deeper on the outstanding problems the Philippines have.

## Our Pedestrians have the highest rate of deaths

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 3.1</b> Road Traffic Deaths in the Philippines, 1990 - 2017</i></figcaption>

<b>Figure 3.1</b> categorizes the deaths shown in <b>Figure 1.1</b> into pedestrian, cyclists, motorcyclists, and drivers & passengers. We can see that the orange trendlines for all of the categories except for the pedestrians are increasing. It might be easy to say to prioritize these more than the pedestrians, but if we actually look at the numbers more closely, the pedestrians have it the worse among all the categories starting from the beginning.

Around 3,000 pedestrians die every year in the Philippines and that number has been consistent. The other categories are on their way to catch up to the pedestrian numbers but it still remains that most of the casualties come from pedestrians, especially when summed out.

## The Philippines is on its way to be 3rd in yearly cyclist deaths

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 4.1</b> Cyclist Road Traffic Deaths in the Philippines, 1990 - 2017</i></figcaption>

When each of the categories were compared to other countries, what was found relevant is the trend of road deaths for cyclists in SEA. Looking at the red trendline which represents the Philippines, we can see that our country is on its way to have the 3rd highest mortality rate for cyclists. Since the data is only up to 2017, we could assume that we probably are in third place this year.

This is another relevant point to focus on, especially in the pandemic we're experiencing, because people are now turning into their bikes as their main mode of transportation. Given the current state of our cycling infrastructure, there could possibly be an increase in casualties.

## The Philippines has the lowest number of railways implemented

<figcaption><i><b>Figure 5.1</b> Railroads built for transportation in SEA</i></figcaption>

Looking at the data from the [International Union of Railways](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.RRS.TOTL.KM){:target="_blank_"}, we could immediately see that the Philippines has the least amount of railways available for transportation among those with available data.

![sea budget](/images/blog/d4g-ph-traff/chart7.PNG){: .center-block :}
<figcaption><i><b>Table 1.1</b> SEA Countries Investments vs Railroads Implemented</i></figcaption>

If we actually compare the investments made by each country to transportation to the total railroads they have, we have countries below the Philippines that have invested less than us but have higher numbers of railroads than us. We should be able to at least complete given the budget that we have, but even if we decide to do so, we have lots of catching up to do because most of the SEA countries here already have railroads implemented that are more than 2,000 kilometers.

## What should the Philippines do?

Capping the points established, these are the clear points of focus for the Philippines in improving our transport infrastructure in the coming years:
- Effective measures in reducing pedestrian casualties
- Invest in Cycling Infrastructure
- Improve Railway Systems

Our country has already started implementing improvements like the [BRT system in Cebu](https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1094751){:target="_blank_"} that not only improves bus transport but also pedestrian safety as well. We also have investments in road extensions like the [3 hour trip from Manila to Baguio via TPLEX](https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1863854/Pampanga/Local-News/TPLEx-reduces-Manila-Baguio-travel-time-to-3-hours){:target="_blank_"} and the [Ortigas - BGC bridge](https://www.topgear.com.ph/news/motoring-news/bgc-ortigas-bridge-meet-a962-20200807){:target="_blank_"} which will hopefully reduce road traffic, but most of these developments are geared towards vehicles in our country.

<b>What we're trying to say is we want to reduce our country's vehicle dependence to reduce road traffic casualties, and in order for us to do it, we have to make sure that the alternatives are safe and efficient in order to promote their use. </b>
