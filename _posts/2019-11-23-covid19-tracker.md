Starting last January, the Philippines has been alert of the Coronavirus outbreak that's happening all around the world. Flights are being suspended, people are being quarantined, and most of all people are always speculating where could the virus could be most likely present in our country.

### One of the Popular Solutions

One of the popular mapping that's done out there is by John Hopkins where it tracks all the types of COVID-19 situations in the world: cases, deaths, and recovered.  But one of its current downsides is that the data is not on a granular level that if I want to observe one country's situation, it's only on an aggregated level. Plus you can't really observe the trend here, its just more of where are the places the virus is mostly active.

## Current Attempts on Mapping the COVID-19 in the Philippines

One of the efforts made is done by _______ where they manually get all the COVID-19 information from news articles in the country.

Another effort done is through Philippines coronavirus outbreak wikipedia page. It reflects data from the DOH website and various news articles as well. It clearly shows which areas have suspected and confirmed cases of the Coronavirus but there is only minimal control of the visualization.

## Our methodology in tracking the COVID-19 cases in the Philippines

**Note:** Data is only until September 2019 since that's when the project was done.
